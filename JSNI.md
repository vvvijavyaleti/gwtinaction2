# Chapter 11 Using JavaScript Native Interface (JSNI) #

JSNI (JavaScript Native Interface) is GWT's way of interacting with pure JavaScript.



This chapter is a little example packed:



## Using JSNI ##
We look at how to implement a getComputedStyle method in GWT, focussing in this chapter on the JSNI aspect.

## JavaScript Object/Overlays ##
JavaScript overlay objects are extremely helpful and powerful when interacting with JavaScript.

We see in this example how to use them and how they compare to plain JavaScript objects.  We also consider a little how to load a JavaScript library.

## Wrapping JSON ##
Now that we understand overlay objects, we can see how simple they make wrapping JSON by simply grabbing and displaying a photo feed from Picasa web service.

## Wrapping a library ##
Time to crank up the complexity a little and see how to wrap an existing JavaScript library.

We wrap the Cooliris photo wall to get this exciting example.

## Exposing an API ##

Sometimes you'll wish to allow other users/applications to access your GWT application on the page - you'll want to expose an API using the techniques we describe in the book (and some implemented in the example)
