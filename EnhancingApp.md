# Chapter 3 - Building a GWT application: Enhancing Hello World #

Once you have the output from Chapter 2, where we examined using tools to create a basic Hello World application, we enhance it to build a real application.





## Concept ##
The chapter describes how we go from the concept:

## Looking at.. ##

  * Widgets (new and wrapping existing HTML)
  * Panels
  * RootPanels
  * DOM Manipulation to get data from HTML page
  * Events and handling
  * History Management
  * Styling (programmatically, with style sheets and with themes)

To understand History Management better, we have a separate project focussing on just that.
